## **Level Summary**

Level 2 reinforces the base mechanics while introducing a new color to the mix. Players learn that obtaining a new color changes Cosmoâ€™s color, switches can have multiple color, and they now know that painting percentage matters for obtaining more mushrooms at the end of the level.
