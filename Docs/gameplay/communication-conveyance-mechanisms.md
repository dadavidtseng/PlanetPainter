# Communication / Conveyance Mechanisms



| **Conveyance**                                  | **Methods**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color Scheme**                                | The Painter Boxes and Blocker Boxes are the same color to show to the player that they are connected. Water Boxes are a different shade of blue to the blue Painter Boxes to indicate there is a difference between them.                                              |
| **Switch Interact Sound Effect**                | When the player paints a switch, a sound effect plays of the switch being moved.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Switch Unlock Sound Effect**                  | When the player unlocks a door by painting a switch a correct color, the sound effect of a lock breaking is played.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Hitting a Blocker Box**                       | Hitting a blocker whilst the wrong color causes Cosmo to react with a hurt sound effect, mushroom particles to fall from Cosmo’s location, and a sound effect of hitting something plays to visually and auditorily convey that this is something wrong to the player. |
| **Level End (Cosmo Dancing & Mushroom pop up)** | Cosmo plays a dancing animation to music as a pop up showing the player how many stars they received shows. The pop up has a sound effect for every mushroom they get (plays 1 to 4 times depending on the number).                                                    |
| **Cosmo Hand in Level Select**                  | To show the player that they can scroll on the level select screen, Cosmo’s hand repeats a scrolling motion on the side of the screen.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Numbered Planets in Level Select**            | Translucent numbers appear on the planets show the player the order the levels appear. The greyed-out numbers tell the player that those planets are not yet unlocked/they need to complete the previous planet to progress.                                           |
| **Blocker Box’s Spikes**                        | Blocker boxes are spikey, jagged, and very rough looking comparatively to the rest of _**Planet Painter**_’s style, an indicator that these are dangerous and the player should avoid them.                                                                            |
