# Player Movement / Interactions

1. Painting
   1. Player walks on painter boxes to absorb their color, allowing him to paint the unpainted areas around him.
   2. Moving causes player to paint the area behind him as well as one tile ahead.
2. Interactions
   1. Player interacts with switches and doors of different colors. Interacting with a switch can produce different effects (i.e. open that colored door) depending on the color he currently is.
   2. Player can only interact with a door that shares the same color as him (i.e. he must be red to interact and open a red door). But if that door is opened, player can be any color to walk through it.
