# Game Description

_**Planet Painter**_ is a single-player mobile game where players solve puzzles to progress through planets and restore color to different worlds!

As Cosmo, a color-changing chameleon, players interact with color-absorbing mushrooms that have drained the world's colorful vibrancy. By walking through these mushrooms, players repaint the environment, interact with objects, and complete levels to bring life back to each planet.

Featuring a cutesy art style and whimsical fantasy backgrounds, Planet Painter appeals to children and fans of cartoony visuals, offering a charming protagonist and delightful gameplay.

Players traverse eight unique levels, striving to repaint each planet. Completing a majority of the painting earns special rewards, adding to the fun and challenge.

Developed in Unity, Planet Painter is optimized for Lenovo M11 tablets and other Android devices with a 1920 x 1200 screen resolution.&#x20;
