# Backstory

In a distant galaxy, a race of chameleon painters lived happily on their vibrant planet. They explored nearby worlds, using their remarkable painting abilities to splash color onto everything they saw.

But everything changed when color-absorbing aliens crash-landed on their planetâ€”and many others. These parasitic mushrooms began stealing color from plants, buildings, and even the chameleons themselves. Cosmo was just a baby when his parents and his entire planet were lost to the mushrooms.

Now, Cosmo is ready to restore color to every planet in the galaxy!
